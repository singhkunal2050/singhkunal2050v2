A few weeks ago, I was working on a large refactor of our backend business logic. The idea was simple: clean up the code, remove some duplication, and make things easier to maintain.

I wasn’t changing any feature.

Just moving logic around — what could possibly go wrong?

Turns out, a *lot*.

### The Breakage

Despite all tests passing locally, things started breaking in production. Certain flows stopped working. Side behaviors disappeared. Internal teams raised tickets.

And I had no clue why.

That’s when I came across **Hyrum’s Law**:

> “With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.”

And suddenly, it all made sense.

### A Simple Code Example

Let’s take a basic function:

```js
function calculatePrice(cart) {
  const total = cart.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
  logEvent('CALCULATION_DONE');
  return total;
}
```

Now imagine I “refactor” it like this:

```js
function calculatePrice(cart) {
  return cart.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}
```

Cleaner, right? But I just removed:

```js
logEvent('CALCULATION_DONE');
```

To me, it was just a side effect.
To some background service relying on that log event… it was everything.

### Porting vs Refactoring

This experience made me clearly see the difference between two approaches:

#### Porting

Moving logic from one place to another **without changing behavior**, even if it’s messy.

#### Refactoring

Changing the internal structure to improve readability or performance — and potentially removing or changing **observable behavior**.

**Porting** tries to preserve everything, including the quirks.
**Refactoring** assumes you can safely clean things up.

But Hyrum’s Law warns: even **accidental behaviors** might be used somewhere.

### My New Checklist

Whenever I’m about to “clean up” legacy logic, I ask:

* Are there side effects (logs, timing, order of calls) that might matter?
* Who uses this function? Are there any downstream dependencies I’m unaware of?
* Am I porting or truly refactoring?

---

### Final Thought

In complex systems, no behavior is truly private.
If it's visible, someone somewhere is depending on it — even if unintentionally.

Refactoring isn’t just about better code. It’s about understanding contracts, expectations, and impact.

So next time you're about to refactor legacy code, remember:
**It’s not just your code. It’s everyone’s expectations of that code.**

*Have you experienced this before? I’d love to hear how you caught invisible dependencies during a refactor.*
