There are several ways to make your fonts fluid across all resolutions in your websites. Here are 5 ways that use regularly in my projects with examples.

* [Good old media queries](#media-queries)
* [Using Percentage (%)](#percentage)
* [clamp() , calc() & minmax() ](#css-functions)
* [Using CSS Variables](#using-css-variables)

Enough talk lets see the code

<div id="media-queries">
