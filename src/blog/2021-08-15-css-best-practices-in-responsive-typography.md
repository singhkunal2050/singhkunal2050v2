There are several ways to make your fonts fluid across all resolutions in your websites. Here are 5 ways that use regularly in my projects with examples.

* [Good old media queries](#media-queries)
* [Using Relative Units vw, vh, Percentage (%)](#relative-units)
* [clamp() , calc() & minmax() ](#css-functions)
* [Using CSS Variables](#using-css-variables)

Enough talk lets see the code

<div id="media-queries">

## Good Old Media Queries `@media-queries`



</div>

<div class="relative-units">

## Using Relative Units `vw` `vh` and `%`


This method uses relative units like percentage, vw and vh and we can set the font size on the basis of parent container(with %) or we can use the vw/vh unit which is used to get sizes relative to the window. Although this method gives a completely fluid typography it has some pitfalls which we can be covered with funtion like minmax coming up next.
