## CSS Logical Properties 

### - What are logical properties 
CSS logical properties are properties which are used to design element on the basis of a particular logic. This logic is related to the writing-mode/language of the content etc.

According to MDN Docs
> CSS Logical Properties and Values is a module of CSS introducing logical properties and values that provide the ability to control layout through logical, rather than physical, direction and dimension mappings.

To go further you have to understand the two types of flow we have in CSS.

1. Block Flow 
Block flow is perpendicular to the flow of the text. Usually [for English] it is the vertical flow. So when you use ```display:block``` the element takes up the entire width and renders the next element on below. 

2. Inline Flow 
Inline flow is parallel to the flow of the text. Usually [for English] it is the horizontal flow. So when you use ```display:inline``` the element takes the minimum width and the next element is rendered adjacent to it.

The box model will give you a good idea of this

### - Why CSS Logical Properties
The more you use logical properties the more you will realise how easy ,inituitive and robust your UI has become after adding them üöÄ. 

Okay enough theory let me share an example with you.

Consider a paragraph with which has a margin left of 20px. Now if you were to make the website multilingual and had converted it into Arabic[right to left language] or Japanese[top to bottom language] not only will this margin cause the UI to break but also make the user experience teribble.

If that went over your head I have another simpler example for you üòÅ. We all had a margin in the left side of the note-book since we write in English[left to right]. Now if someone is writing in Arabic[right to left] this margin is useless. So what css logical properties suggest says, Why use ```margin-left``` when you can use ```margin-inline-start```. When the writing starts from left the margin will be added to left and when the language starts from right the margin is added to right. Same for Top to bottom languages aswell.  

In summary if you start using logical properties in your css. You will have a more accessible UI which works across different languages and writing modes.

## Example of CSS Logical Properties

Here you just have to remember the rules for block and inline flow. These are paired up with start and end. When you use something like   ```margin-block-start``` or   ```margin-block-end```. You can also use  ```margin-block``` which adds  margin to the start and end of the block, same applies for inline flow aswell.
