# Top Terminal Commands I Use For Productivity

The whole point of development is solving problems. But very often we *Developers* overlook our very own problems which we face while developing the products/solutions to these problems. One such classic solution example for boosting productivity is use of keyboard for most of our tasks. This is done using what we call the **Terminal**. 
Use Terminal can drastically improve your performance and workflow. Once you're comfortable you will never look back to the old way of opening a folder, deleting a file etc.
Okay enough talk let me share the top 10 commands I use for improving my productivity as a Developer. Many of them might seem obvious while some are new and might help you in your workflow.

### 1] pwd , cd , mkdir , rmdir , ls

These are regular commands for regular operations which we normally do with a File Explorer 

`pwd` - Shows Present Working Directory
`ls` - List all files in Current Directory
`cd folder_name` -  Change Current Directory
`mkdir folder_name` - Make New Directory
`rmdir folder_name` - Remove Directory
`cp source/file.name ../destination/folder` - Copy File 
`mv source/file.name ../destination/folder` - Move File 

### 2] The code command (For VS Code Users)

`code filename.txt`
Opening a file in VS Code

`code .` or `code filepath/project`
Opening current folder or specific folder in Vs Code 

### 3] ipconfig

Used to get the local ip address which i use to test my apps on other devices on the same network like mobile/tablets.
